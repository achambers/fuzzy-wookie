# Master

# 3.0.9
* [Bugfix] no longer include promise-aplus tests as a production
  dependency
* [Enhancement] fast then path for both rejection/fulfilment [0d252](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/commit/0d252ed4831eabb82991584e2e3eaae2a3a2ba42)

# 3.0.7

* improve tests in some older es5+ browsers
* [Bugfix] denodeify should not use console for deprecation warning unless console is defined
* [Enhancement] instrumentation should emit out-of-band. This should improve ember-extension performance
* [Bugfix] race should not be susceptible to zalgo
* [Perf] PromiseEnumerator increase performance of all enumerable methods all/allSettled/hash/hasSettled -> https://gist.github.com/stefanpenner/26465d5848f2924e2aca
* [Docfix] Fix small documentation inconsistency
* [Perf] an internal promise shouldn't bother validating `this` and `resolver`
* [Perf] flatten asap’s QUEUE structure
* [Perf] Reduce Constructor AST size.
* [Perf] some versions of v8, think keep marking these functions to be optimized. This hints to them not to be.
* [Perf] accidental resolve step, that merely needed to be a fulfill
* [Perf/Enhancement] simplify publishing
* [Spec ADdition]add spec test “Ensure `then` is always called with a clean stack.” ensure RSVP passes future a+ spec
* [Bugfix] web worker support
* [Docfix] Add a param name to make yuidoc happy
* [Enhancement] simplify async vs sync pub/sub code-paths
* [Bugfix] Passed the label through to the Promise object, as expected
* [Docfix] missing Parentheses on promise example in documentation
* [License] Add Stefan Penner to license
* [Docfix] document `var promises` in filter.js

  https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping

* RSVP.hash: now now casts rather then resolves, and doesn't touch the

  MutationObserver polyfils
