#Fuzzy Wookie

This is a basic server designed to serve an index html as a part of an Ember CLI deploy

#Motivation

This server is heavily inspired by Luke Melia's chat about [Lightening Fast Deployment of Your Rails-backed Javascript App][1]

While his chat is about deploying from Rails, this is an attempt at a port to Node for use with [Ember-CLI][2].
